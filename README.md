-  Hi.
-  I'm Max, a passionate self-taught back end developer from Italy. My passion for software drives me to care about the architecture and code quality of the things I build.

Whenever I decide to automate and improve my work processes, even if it takes up some of my time at first, I realize that it actually saves me a lot of precious time in the long run, and this is fascinating.
Those who think like me contact me because I have a good idea about this.
