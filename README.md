- 👋 Hi, I’m Max.
- 👀 I am interested in learning how to program well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java
- 💞️I started in October 2019 an Analyst Programmer course in Rome.
The course will run through May 2022.
I will try to post some of my projects.
Then I will do another one that will last two years including an internship in a company for 6 months.
